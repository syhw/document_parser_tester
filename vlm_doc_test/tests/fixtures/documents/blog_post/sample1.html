                Machine learning has become one of the most exciting and in-demand skills in tech today.
                Whether you're a software developer looking to expand your skillset or someone completely
                new to programming, this guide will help you get started on your ML journey.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Learn Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>
                The applications of machine learning are everywhere - from recommendation systems on Netflix
                to voice assistants like Siri, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis. The field is
                growing rapidly, and there's never been a better time to dive in.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this post, I'll share my experience learning ML over the past three years and provide
                a roadmap for beginners. Let's get started!
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Master the Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>
                Before jumping into complex neural networks, you need a solid foundation in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python programming</strong> - The de facto language for ML</li>
                <li><strong>Linear algebra</strong> - Vectors, matrices, and operations</li>
                <li><strong>Probability and statistics</strong> - Essential for understanding ML algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>Calculus</strong> - Particularly derivatives for gradient descent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Don't let the math scare you! You can start with practical coding and learn the theory
                gradually as you go.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Learn the Core Libraries</h2>
            <p>
                The Python ecosystem has amazing libraries that make ML accessible:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>NumPy</strong> - Numerical computing and array operations</li>
                <li><strong>Pandas</strong> - Data manipulation and analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Matplotlib/Seaborn</strong> - Data visualization</li>
                <li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong> - Machine learning algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>TensorFlow/PyTorch</strong> - Deep learning frameworks</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>

            <h2>Step 3: Build Real Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Theory is important, but hands-on practice is crucial. Start with simple projects like:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Iris flower classification (the "Hello World" of ML)</li>
                <li>House price prediction</li>
                <li>Movie recommendation system</li>
                <li>Image classifier for cats vs dogs</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Each project teaches you different concepts and builds your portfolio.
            </p>

            <h2>Recommended Resources</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some excellent resources I've used:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng's ML Course</a> - The classic intro</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fast.ai/">Fast.ai</a> - Practical deep learning</li>
                <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-learn Documentation</a> - Best reference for traditional ML</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> - Practice with real datasets</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Learning machine learning is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself, code
                every day, and don't be afraid to ask questions. The ML community is incredibly welcoming
                and helpful.
            </p>
