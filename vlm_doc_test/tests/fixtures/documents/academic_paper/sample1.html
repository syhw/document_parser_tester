            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                We present novel optimization techniques for deep neural networks that significantly
                improve training convergence and generalization performance. Our approach combines
                adaptive learning rates with momentum-based gradient descent, achieving state-of-the-art
                results on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show a 15% improvement in accuracy
                compared to baseline methods while reducing training time by 30%.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning in recent years [1, 2]. However,
                training deep neural networks remains challenging due to issues such as vanishing
                gradients, slow convergence, and overfitting [3].
            </p>
            <p>
                In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new optimization algorithm
                that adaptively adjusts learning rates based on gradient history. Our contributions
                include:

            <ul>
                <li>A novel adaptive learning rate schedule</li>
                <li>Integration with momentum-based optimization</li>
                <li>Comprehensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="methods">
            <h2>2. Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Our optimization algorithm builds upon stochastic gradient descent (SGD) but incorporates
                two key innovations: adaptive learning rate scaling and momentum accumulation.
            </p>
            <h3>2.1 Adaptive Learning Rate</h3>
            <p>
                The learning rate at iteration t is computed as:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                α(t) = α₀ / √(1 + γt)
            </p>
            <p>
                where α₀ is the initial learning rate and γ is the decay parameter.

                We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST datasets. Table 1 shows
                the comparison with baseline methods.

            <p>
                We have presented a novel optimization approach that combines adaptive learning rates
                with momentum-based updates. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements
                over existing methods. Future work will explore applications to reinforcement learning
                and natural language processing tasks.
